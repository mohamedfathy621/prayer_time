## What is this extension ??

this is a mini extension for prayer timings depending on the time zone your pc has set

## why make this extension ??

1-most of remote workers in egypt set thier pc timing to match the country they are working in which makes it hard for them to keep tracking prayer times.
2-most of us rely on setting alarms and using prayer time apps as reminders 
3-some of us working in office spaces cannot hear the adhan 
4-some of us when working can lose track of time 

## what does this extension do ??

this extension is very basic for a start 

1- it gives you pop up notifications every 5 minutes about the nearest prayer 
2- it gives you pop up notifications about upcoming prayers if they are under 10 minuts close 
3- by using the command interface (CTRL+SHIFT+P) and writing the command pray it returns a list of prayer times for today

## how does it work ??

it uses adhan api to get a list of prayer times by date for cairo it then it tunes the prayer times to match your PC time zone 

## can I change the country ??

the repo is public you can easily change the country and the city
